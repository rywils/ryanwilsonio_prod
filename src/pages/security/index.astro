<h2 class="text-(--primary-blue) text-lg py-4">1. Our Scope </h2>
<p >This policy applies to all publicly accessible domains and subdomains owned and operated by Ryan Wilson.

<p >Primary Domain: ryanwilson.io</p>

<p >Subdomains: All live, in-scope subdomains (if applicable).</p>

<p>Note: Any assets hosted by third-party services (e.g., social media platforms, analytics provider domains, payment processors) are generally considered out of scope, unless a vulnerability in their integration directly compromises the primary assets listed above.</p>

<h2 class="text-(--primary-blue) text-lg py-4">2. How to Report a Vulnerability</h2>
<p>If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability on ryanwilson.io, please report it to the site owner as quickly and confidentially as possible.</p>

<p>Contact Method: Please email the site owner directly:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>
Email: security@ryanwilson.io or ryan@ryanwilson.io (or the most secure contact method provided on the site's contact page)
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p-3 text-lg">Reporting Requirements: Your report should be detailed enough to allow for accurate reproduction and validation of the vulnerability. This includes:</h3>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4">

<li>A detailed description of the vulnerability.</li>

<li>The specific URL(s) and affected parameter(s).</li>

<li>A step-by-step proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit.</li>

<li>Any necessary setup or configuration details (e.g., browser, user agent, account type).</li>

<li>The severity assessment, if possible (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-(--primary-blue) text-lg py-4">3. Our Commitment to Researchers</h2>
<p class="py-2">We commit to working with you openly and efficiently throughout the disclosure process:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4">


<li>Response: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 5 business days.</li>

<li>Validation: We will provide an estimated timeline for validation and remediation within 7 business days.</li>

<li>Remediation: We commit to remediating confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as development resources allow, prioritizing based on severity.</li>

<li>Credit: We are happy to recognize security researchers who follow this policy and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (unless you request anonymity).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-(--primary-blue) text-lg py-4">4. Responsible Disclosure Guidelines (What You Must Follow)</h2>
<p class="py-2">By engaging in vulnerability research against ryanwilson.io, you agree to adhere to the following rules:</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4">

<li>No Service Disruption: Do not perform any testing that could negatively impact the site's availability, stability, or integrity (e.g., Denial of Service attacks, spamming forms).</li>

<li>Privacy Protection: Do not access, modify, or retain any user data, personal information, or proprietary information. If accidental access occurs, stop immediately and report the incident.</li>

<li>Non-Destructive Testing: Use non-destructive testing methods. Do not attempt to modify or delete data, or escalate privileges beyond what is necessary to prove the vulnerability.</li>

<li>Rate Limits: Respect rate limits and do not engage in automated scanning that generates high volumes of traffic.</li>

<li>Third-Party Disclosure: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability to any third party (e.g., on social media, blogs, forums) until we have confirmed remediation is complete.</li>

<h2 class="text-(--primary-blue) text-lg py-4">5. Out of Scope Activities</h2>
<p class="py-2">The following actions are strictly prohibited and considered outside the scope of this policy:</p>
</ul>
<ul class="list-disc ml-4">

<li>Social Engineering: Any attempts to phish, abuse, or harass employees, contractors, or users.</li>

<li>Physical or Automated Attacks: Physical attempts against facilities or automated attacks such as DDoS.</li>

<li>Publicly Known Issues: Reports on vulnerabilities that are already known, fixed, or publicly disclosed without demonstrating a specific impact on ryanwilson.io.</li>

<li>Weak Security Headers/Best Practices: Reports related solely to missing best practices (e.g., missing sub-domain CNAME checks, clickjacking on static content, missing security headers where no exploit is demonstrated).</li>

<li>Self XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): XSS that requires a user to paste code into their own browser console.</li>

<li>Rate Limiting: Lack of rate limiting on minor forms (e.g., contact form, resume download) where the risk is purely nuisance spam.</li>
</ul>
