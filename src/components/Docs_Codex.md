This is an outline for you to follow.

This has been an extemely difficult road to get here. I have been
trying to get this animation to work for the longest time. Inside Hero, you will notice the icons that are supposed to animate around the logo. Currently, they are not positioned correctly. I need you to fit them so they are perfectly aligned with the border of the avatar. They should keep their animation with no change. Nothing else should be changed except whatever is absolutely needed to get the positioning to work properly.
